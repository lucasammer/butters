# Butters

The butters programming language is a language that is made in c#, its runtime and compiler are highly customisable since it first outputs to a json like structure to then be further compiled or ran

# usage

to compile a butters file (.btrs) use the command:

```
Butters comp file.btrs
```

to run a compiled file (.bcomp):

```
Butters run file.bcomp
```

to do both after eachother:

```
Butters do file.btrs
```
